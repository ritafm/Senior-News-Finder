Easy Poster

Idea: The Marketing Assistants at the senior retirement community in which I work are asked to search for and post articles on Facebook that match our brand image.  This entails quite a bit of time spent online searching and curating articles.  I am creating an app with pre-set search parameters that will return appropriate, on-message articles from reputable sources and enable easy posting to the corporate Facebook site.

Target Audience: Marketing Assistants (although broader appeal is possible)

Problem: Our problem is that Marketing Assistants need to spend significant amounts of time searching for content to post on our Facebook pages (multiple pages connected to unique communities but all with the same target audience).  This is complicated by some of our staff having challenges such as difficulty identifying safe vs unreliable sources, identifying on-brand topics and varying the types of content posted.

Goal: My goal is to provide fast, reliable content that still allows the user some freedom to personalize the message.
