Easy Poster

Idea: The Marketing Assistants at the senior retirement community in which I work are asked to search for and post articles on Facebook that match our brand image.  This entails quite a bit of time spent online searching and curating articles.  I am creating an app with pre-set search parameters that will return appropriate, on-message articles from reputable sources and enable easy posting to the corporate Facebook site.

Target Audience: Transforming Age Marketing Assistants (although broader appeal is possible)

Problem: Our problem is that Marketing Assistants need to spend significant amounts of time searching for content to post on our Facebook pages (multiple pages connected to unique communities but all with the same target audience).  This is complicated by some of our staff having challenges such as difficulty identifying safe vs unreliable sources, identifying on-brand topics and varying the types of content posted.

Goal: My goal is to provide fast, reliable content that still allows the user some freedom to personalize the message.
 
User Stories: Fahima knows she needs to post content 2 - 4 times per week but she is very busy.  She logs into her quick-post app which has the login credentials for the company Facebook page already stored.  She sees 3 buttons- “general news”, “health news”, and “financial news.”  She posted 2 health stories last week so she decides to click “general news.”  Three articles are returned and they are from well-known, reputable sources.  Each article has a “post to Facebook” link next to it.  She picks one of the three (clicking on them to proof-read opens the article in a new window so she doesn’t need to login to the app again) and clicks to post it.  A modal pops up that asks her to compose a comment and when she clicks again, it is auto-posted to the company Facebook page.  A task that previously took 15-30 minutes, now takes two minutes.
